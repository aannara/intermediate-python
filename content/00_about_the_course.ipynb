    "1. Make sure you have Python installed. Follow the guide in the official Python documentation on how to do it for different operating systems: [Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installation-steps), [Mac](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#getting-and-installing-macpython), or [Unix](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python) systems.\n",
    "2. Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/aannara/intermediate-python.git`\n",
    "3. Change directory to the new one: `cd intermediate-python`\n",
    "4. Recommended creating a virtual environment to install the dependencies: `python -m venv .venv`\n",

    "    * On Windows:  `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "    * On Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "6. Install all the dependencies in the virtual environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "7. Run Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`\n",
